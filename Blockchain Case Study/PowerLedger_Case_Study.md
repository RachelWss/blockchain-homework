# Case Study Proposal: PowerLedger

## What Is It

Power Ledger is an Australian based startup that has developed a world-first blockchain enabled peer-to-peer(P2P) electricity sharing. They are developing systems that bring resilience and flexibility to electricity grids. The company is looking to sustain the growth that initially began with its widly successful $34 million initial coin offering, which itself came after Power Ledger was named one of the recipients of an $8 million government smart cities grant. 

## Why This Matters

Renewable energy is undergoing a global transformation-from mass adoption of rootop PV systems to large-scale wind and solar farms.But the monumental shift in energy systems comes with challenges as grids are forced to adapt to new power sources.Their project, which involves academic, infrastructure and technology partners,  assess how cities can use blockchain technology and data analytics to integrate distributed energy and water systems.  

## Why This May be Interesting

Power Ledger provide a platform for a fully modernized, market-driven grid that offers consumers choice in energy while driving the democratization of power. Market mechanisms facilitated by blockchain technology can deliver the energy systems of the future without government subsidy. For example, Power Ledger's xGrid enables households and businesses to sell energy generated from their solar panels to other energy consumers connected across the same electricity grid. It can do this with customers with the same electricity retailer or across different retailers, it doesnâ€™t make a difference. The blockchain system keeps track of it all.
